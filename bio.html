                    <p>Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber
                        the living. Since the dawn of time, roughly a hundred billion human beings have walked the
                        planet Earth.</p>
                    <p>Now this is an interesting number, for by a curious coincidence there are approximately a hundred
                        billion stars in our local universe, the Milky Way. So for every man who has ever lived, in this
                        Universe there shines a star.</p>
                    <p>But every one of those stars is a sun, often far more brilliant and glorious than the small,
                        nearby star we call the Sun. And many--perhaps most--of those alien suns have planets circling
                        them. So almost certainly there is enough land in the sky to give every member of the human
                        species, back to the first ape-man, his own private, world-sized heaven--or hell.</p>

                        we have no way of guessing; the very nearest is a million times farther away than Mars or Venus,
                        those still remote goals of the next generation. But the barriers of distance are crumbling; one
                        day we shall meet our equals, or our masters, among the stars.</p>
                    <p>Men have been slow to face this prospect; some still hope that it may never become reality.
                        Increasing numbers, however are asking; 'Why have such meetings not occurred already, since we
                        ourselves are about to venture into space?'</p>
                    <p>Why not, indeed? Here is one possible answer to that very reasonable question. But please
                        remember: this is only a work of fiction.</p>
                    <p>The truth, as always, will be far stranger.</p>

                    <p>Norton turned his head. Ten metres away was a slender-legged tripod surmounted by a spherical
                        body no larger than a football. Set around the body were three large, expressionless eyes,
                        apparently giving 360 degrees of vision, and trailing beneath it were three whiplike tendrils.
                        The creature was not quite as tall as a man, and looked far too fragile to be dangerous, but
                        that did not excuse their carelessness in letting it sneak up on them unawares. It reminded
                        Norton of nothing so much as a three-legged spider, or daddy-long-legs, and he wondered how it
                        had solved the problem - never challenged by any creature on Earth - of tripedal locomotion.</p>
                    <p>After regarding them passively for several minutes, the creature suddenly moved, and now they
                        could understand why they had failed to observe its arrival. It was fast, and it covered the
                        ground with such an extraordinary spinning motion that the human eye and mind had real
                        difficulty in following it.</p>
                    <p>...each leg in turn acted as a pivot around which the creature whirled its body... it also seemed
                        to him that every few 'steps' it reversed its direction of spin, while the three whips flickered
                        over the ground like lightning as it moved.</p>
                    <p>Most of the spider is simply a battery, much like that found in electric eels and rays... It's
                        the creature's source of energy.</p>
